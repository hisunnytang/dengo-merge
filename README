# Dengo: An Engineer for Chemistry Solvers

Hi there! Welcome to Dengo. Dengo is a Python system for symbolically describing a system of chemical species, chemical kinetic rate equations, cooling functions, and then producing from these a set of numerical kernels to calculate the “right hand side” and Jacobian of this system. These two numerical kernels can then be linked into one of several ODE solvers.

Dengo is best thought of as a way to create a chemistry and cooling solver that you can stick into a codebase. Rather than trying to tie together the four separate parts – species, reactions, rate coefficients and the solver itself – into a single whole, Dengo allows you to construct each item individually and join them at the final step before inserting them into a simulation code.
