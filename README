This is the Dengo package, designed to be a meta-solver for chemical reaction
networks and cooling processes.  The purpose of this is to provide a simple and
maintainable way of defining microphysical solvers for updating the chemical
and thermodynamic state of fluids in astrophysical simulations.  It has been
designed to output a C solver which can call external solver libraries, as well
as affiliated reaction rate tables.
