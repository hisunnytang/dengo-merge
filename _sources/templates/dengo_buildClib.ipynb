    "# Build C-library\n",
    "This template comes with a `Makefile` that lets the user to compile the library. Apart from specifying the `CVODE_PATH`, `SUITESPARSE_PATH`, `DENGO_INSTALL_PATH`, `HDF5_PATH`, there are additional options the user can choose. One can choose either the `CVDLS` which refers to the CVODE dense linear solver, or `CVKLU` which refers to the CVODE KLU Sparse solver. `CVKLU` is oftentimes preferred as it leverages the emptyness in the Jacobian matrix, and utilizes the SuiteSparse library to perform the newton iterations. `DENGO_INSTALL_PATH` is where the library will be installed. `MAX_NCELLS` determines how many cells would be batched together when the `CVODE` solver is invoked.\n",

It also informs the setup of the incoming grid. `code_units` informs the dengo solver how to convert from code_units into physical cgs units. `dt` is the delta time the user want to advance the system for.
