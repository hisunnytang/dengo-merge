# Welcom to Dengo Cookbook

This is the Dengo package, designed to be a meta-solver for chemical reaction networks and cooling processes.  The purpose of this is to provide a simple and
maintainable way of defining microphysical solvers for updating the chemical and thermodynamic state of fluids in astrophysical simulations.  It has been
designed to output a C solver which can call external solver libraries, as well as affiliated reaction rate tables.
