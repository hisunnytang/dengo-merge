    "# Create Cooling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The release/ absorption of energy via various physical process would modify the thermal state of the medium, which might in turn accelerates/ terminates further reactions. Keeping track of the thermal energy through the course of evolution is quintessential to the accurate modeling of the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "While it is termed cooling actions, or cooling function in `dengo`, it is **not** limited only to cooling functions. This module can account for general modifications to the thermal energy of the fluid parcel $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}$ whether it is injecting/ releasing energy from the fluid parcel. For example, when molecular hydrogen is formed from 3-body reactions, $4.48 eV$ is released. We will demonstrate that how to account for the chemical heating in one of the chapters to follow. \n",

    "$k01$ is the reaction that describes the recombination of an ionized hydrogen atom with an electron. Energy is released as a result of such process.\n",

    "## Register new cooling functions with the `cooling_action` decorator\n",
    "Similar to reactions, the cooling functions can be specified with a decorator `dengo.reaction_classes.cooling_action`.\n",
    "a `cooling_action` to `dengo` is primarily composed of:\n",
    "- **name** of the cooling function, i.e. `reHII`\n",
    "- **Cooling Equation**, `-reHII * HII * de`\n",
    "- **Cooling Rate**, that often times dependent on the temperature of the gas parcel, and sometimes on external factors as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, `HII` and `de` are defined and registered in `dengo` species registry. `reHII` the cooling rate associated to this particular cooling function. The cooling rate takes `eq` as an input. `@eq.table` register the cooling rates that are dependent on temperature. From then on `dengo` would associate the symbol `reHII` appeared in the cooling equation to the user-supplied cooling rate `def reHII(state)` internally."
